---=== OVERVIEW ===---
This is a 2D Lighting Program, made in the Processing Language Environment. 

---=== DEBUGGING ===---
This program has been tested on Processing 3.3.2 revision 0259 without any issues.
If you run into any errors please make sure you are on this version because it is
known to work. If you still are having issues on the aforementioned version, just
send me a message on my GitHub page (https://github.com/mattdocherty314).

---=== PROGRAM USE ===---
When the program is launched, you will have to wait while it renders the scene
where there are three solid squares and rectangles, in the top leftand then a
white transparent one in the bottom right. It renders it using the CPU, which
makes it really slow to render. If using an Intel Core (8th Gen), i7-8700, it
will take approximately 256 seconds. It is dependent on single core performance.
